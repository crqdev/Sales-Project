# Sales-Project
Creating Program to notify users of sales that receive a high amount traffic early in their lifetime.

The Reddit Folder contains the code for running the notification system for reddit.com/r/buildapcsales

The SlickDeals Folder contains the files needed to run the webscraper(SD_DataCollection.py) and notification system(SD_Notify) that are in progress. 

Sales System folder is the results of combining SlickDeals and Reddit systems into one. The need for a server is no longer needed. Users can simply update the config.py file with their API keys.
